ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm @VictorienO!

I'm a geomatics engineering student at the National School of Geographic Science (ENSG) in France. Right now, I'm digging deeper ðŸ¦¦ into my computer science specialization, picking up new skills, and broadening my knowledge in this exciting field.

Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to tweak or add!
